"""Pluggable eviction policies for the GPU Automatic Prefix Cache (APC).

Each policy implements BaseAPCPolicy. The worker holds one policy instance
(_apc_policy) and calls insert/touch/evict_one/remove through it.

Block accounting (_apc_reserved_blocks, free_gpu_blocks) lives in the worker;
policies only manage the *identity* of which block hashes are cached and which
to evict next — they do not touch counters.
